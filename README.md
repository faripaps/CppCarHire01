##Car Hire System

this is a simple car hire system

This code defines two classes: `Car` and `CarHireSystem`. The `Car` class represents an individual car with attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and rental status. The `CarHireSystem` class manages a collection of cars and provides functionalities to add a car, rent a car, return a car, and display available and rented cars.

In the main function, we create an instance of the `CarHireSystem` and add some sample cars. We then demonstrate renting a car, displaying the available and rented cars, returning the rented car, and displaying the available and rented cars again.
